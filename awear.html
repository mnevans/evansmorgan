    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>AWEAR MOBILE APPLICATION</strong></h3>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">UW INFORMATION SCHOOL CAPSTONE '16</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Team Size:</strong> 4 | <strong>Role:</strong> UX Researcher + Designer | <strong>Software Used:</strong> Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator | <strong>Date:</strong> Jan-June 2016</p>

    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>aWear (pronounced uh-wear) was my University of Washington Informatics Capstone 2016 project, which won runner-up for the Social Impact Award. Over the course of 6 months, my team (2 designers, a developer and a PM) created a fully-functioning companion application to the Microsoft Band 2 wearable device that read in real-time data and alerted a user of a potential life threatening emergency. The official pitch video is here and the project can be viewed on the Information School's website here.</p>

    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>We discovered that there were no effective methods of monitoring the health of loved ones in a real-time, automated and efficient way, so created aWear - a companion application to a user's wearable technology (such as Microsoft Band 2) that allows family members to control and monitor when they receive alerts of their loved one's health information. In doing so, we hope to increase interconnection between elders and their loved ones, expand wearable technology usage to a new demographic and help raise awareness for heart related health problems.</p>

  	<h3>STAKEHOLDERS</h3>
  	<p>The stakeholders for this project were 1. the Users: elders (~65+) with a history of health problems and 2. the Monitors: young, tech-savvy and family-involved. I used Illustrator to create two personas better detailing these stakeholders.</p>

  	<h3>RESEARCH + USER FLOWS</h3>
  	<p>I created a public survey to collect data about how many people currently use wearables, which ones, what they typically use them for, if them and/or a loved one has experienced a medical emergency and to gauge the interest level on a wearable that would monitor somebody's health. I received 100 responses from people aged 20-65+, in which 40% said themselves or a family member has a history of medical problems, 100% said they had never used/heard of an application that monitors and alerts them of specific health conditions and 100% said they would be interested in such an idea. From here, we all conducted more research on what the Microsoft Band 2 is capable of in terms of data and monitoring and then I created the three primary user flows (1. Monitor, 2. User, 3. Interacting with alerts).</p>

  	<h3>WHITE BOARDING + PAPER PROTOTYPES</h3>
  	<p>Taking our use cases and flow diagrams in to account, I conducted a white boarding session for our potential application screens and to map out the key features (clean and simple dashboard view of the data being monitored, a real-time and interactive graph, alert preferences and receiving/dismissing alerts). I then converted these drawings over to paper prototypes for initial user testing.</p>

  	<h3>FIRST ITERATION</h3>
  	<p>For the first iteration of our high fidelity prototype, the entire team selected two primary colors and then the other designer and I chose the secondary and tertiary colors. We then both created a moodboard to guide our prototype building efforts. We tried to choose gender mutual colors and use flat icons to give the interface a modern, simple design. I also used Photoshop and Illustrator to create the first version logo. The InVision clickable prototype is here.</p>

  	<h3>FINAL ITERATION</h3>
  	<p>I conducted 5 usability tests on the first clickable prototype and reported back the key findings and changes to be made for the second (and final) iteration: <strong>1.</strong> make the background color to be more opaque as it is distracting and does not look professional, <strong>2.</strong> alter the Dashboard to be more intuitive and easy to read, <strong>3.</strong> more options regarding privacy in Settings; the app contains personal information and users that are being monitored should have say in what others can see, <strong>4.</strong> better show the difference between Account and Settings. With these findings, I used the same colors but made a new skin and refined the logo. The other designer and I both simplified the dashboard's information and make all of the screens simplified and more intuitive.</p>

    <h3>WHAT I LEARNED</h3>
    <p>My biggest lesson from this project was to keep constant communication with the developers on a project, because not all designs are achievable with code. Us two designers went off and mocked up screens with fairly complex functionalities and displays, and when we came back to the developer he simply told us it could not be done due to the learning curve in such a short period of time. This forced us to scramble and work with him to create and help implement screens that were both visually appealing and practical.</p>
