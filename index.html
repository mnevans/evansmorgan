    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>I am a Seattle-based UX Designer and Front End Developer, and University of Washington graduate with a B.S. in Informatics and a concentration on Human-Computer Interaction. Outside of design and development, I enjoy hiking, traveling and wine and food tasting.</p>

    <h3>Why UX and Front End?</h3>
    <p>After teaching myself basic web design and development at the ripe age of 13, I found my inherit passion. UX design and front end development are the perfect balance of design, people and technology, and I find adventure and joy in integrating these as a professional. Overall, I aim to create aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly and unparalleled user experiences for digital products and platforms.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Although it varies based on project needs, I tend to design and code with several simple principles in mind.</p>

	<h3>Discovery</h3>
	<p>Make sure that the right problem is being addressed, and then research and conceptualize the problem via user flows and analysis, personas, white boarding, sketching--whatever it takes.</p>

	<h3>Design</h3>
	<p>Refine the findings and conceptual models to establish the key functionalities and look and feel, then transform it all into a hi fi prototype.</p>

	<h3>Develop</h3>
	<p>Bring the designs to life and give them working interactions and features, while focusing on providing the same aesthetics and user experience.</p>

	<h3>Deliver</h3>
	<p>Present the products to the stakeholders, project team, etc., and allow them to critique the work and eventually move it to testing (usability studies, A/B testing, etc.)</p>

	<h3>Do it again!</h3>
	<p>Once user feedback has been received and analyzed, go back to whichever step is necessary and do it all again! Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p>
