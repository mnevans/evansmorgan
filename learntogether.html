    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>Learn Together is a startup focused on the social learning of soft skills (e.g. customer service, leadership, collaboration). It is partnered with customer service-centered companies to help teach their employees how to improve upon their soft skills via direct mentorship with other employees and Learn Together users.</p>

    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>The objective of this project was to create a high fidelity prototype for the Learn Together Version 2 mobile application. The goal was to make it simple, intuitive and focused on helping companies improve their customer service with a social networking component.</p>

  	<h3>STAKEHOLDERS</h3>
  	<p>The primary stakeholder for this service is Starbucks to train their baristas in customer service. Others are Alaska Air to aid their airplane stewards, Costco and REI.</p>

  	<h3>RESEARCH + USE CASES</h3>
  	<p>Refine the findings and conceptual models to establish the key functionalities and look and feel, then transform it all into a hi fi prototype.</p>

  	<h3>FIRST ITERATION</h3>
  	<p>Bring the designs to life and give them working interactions and features, while focusing on providing the same aesthetics and user experience.</p>

  	<h3>SECOND ITERATION</h3>
  	<p>Present the products to the stakeholders, project team, etc., and allow them to critique the work and eventually move it to testing (usability studies, A/B testing, etc.)</p>

  	<h3>FINAL ITERATION</h3>
  	<p>Once user feedback has been received and analyzed, go back to whichever step is necessary and do it all again! Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p>

    <h3>WHAT I LEARNED</h3>
    <p>Once user feedback has been received and analyzed, go back to whichever step is necessary and do it all again! Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p>
