                      <p>aWear (pronounced uh-wear) was my University of Washington Informatics Capstone 2016 project, which won runner-up for the Social Impact Award. Over the course of 6 months, my team (2 designers, a developer and a PM) created a fully-functioning companion application to the Microsoft Band 2 wearable device that read in real-time data and alerted a user of a potential life threatening emergency. The official pitch video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIruznY7z14">here</a> and the project can be viewed on the Information School's website <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/capstone/projects/2016/awear">here</a>.</p>

                      <p>We discovered that there were no effective methods of monitoring the health of loved ones in a real-time, automated and efficient way, so created aWear - a companion application to a user's wearable technology (such as Microsoft Band 2) that allows family members to control and monitor when they receive alerts of their loved one's health information. In doing so, we hope to increase interconnection between elders and their loved ones, expand wearable technology usage to a new demographic and help raise awareness for heart related health problems.</p>

I received 100 responses from people aged 20-65+, in which 40% said themselves or a family member has a history of medical problems, 100% said they had never used/heard of an application that monitors and alerts them of specific health conditions and 100% said they would be interested in such an idea. From here, we all conducted more research on what the Microsoft Band 2 is capable of in terms of data and monitoring and then I created the three primary user flows (1. Monitor, 2. User, 3. Interacting with alerts).</p>

With these findings, I used the same colors but made a new skin and refined the logo. The other designer and I both simplified the dashboard's information and make all of the screens simplified and more intuitive.</p>

                        <p>My biggest lesson from this project was to keep constant communication with the developers on a project, because not all designs are achievable with code. Us two designers went off and mocked up screens with fairly complex functionalities and displays, and when we came back to the developer he simply told us it could not be done due to the learning curve in such a short period of time. This forced us to scramble and work with him to create and help implement screens that were both visually appealing and practical.</p>
